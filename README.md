# libgmultigrid
A header-only library for geometric multigrid.

The recommended way to use this library is by adding it as a submodule to your current project. Navigate to the directory you would like to clone the submodule into, and then run:
```
git submodule add https://github.com/icethrush/libgmultigrid.git
```
After this, add libgmultigrid/include to your include paths, and you should be able to use it in your code.
